## TestTrack Split Config Management

Provides the `testtrack` command line interface as part of Betterment's [TestTrack](https://github.com/Betterment/test_track) open source split testing and feature gating platform.

The `testtrack` CLI has the following features:

* Provides an app-language-agnostic developer experience for configuring TestTrack splits from your shell alongside your app code.
* Manages TestTrack migrations representing those configuration changes within your application's codebase so that your split configs follow your code from development, through tests and into production via plugging `testtrack migrate` into your build/deploy pipeline.
* Provides a zero-config dependency-free simplified implementation of the TestTrack server REST API for developers to use when developing locally (or on a cloud VM/container if that's your cup of tea).

## Getting started

1. Download/install testtrack CLI

Currently TestTrack binaries for linux and macOS are distributed via [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Betterment/testtrack-cli/releases). We'll add a homebrew tap soon to assist in installing and daemonizing the server on macOS.

2. Initialize your project

From your app root directory run:

```bash
testtrack init_project
```

This will create a `testtrack` subdirectory in your app that will store migration and schema YAML files. *Commit these files to your repository.*

It will also create a `~/.testtrack` directory that will hold your local server's assignment overrides (`assignments.yml`).

3. Set up your app name in .env

```bash
# [my_app_root]/.env
TESTTRACK_APP_NAME=my_app
```

This is the name that your app will use to authenticate with TestTrack server in production (and any other environments you support). Typically in a unirepo, this can be your app repo name.

4. Point your app's TestTrack client at the testtrack fake server for development

You'll be embedding the same app name as you used above into the URL, e.g. `http://my_app@localhost:8297`

5. Configure your application bootstrap scripts

You'll want to install the platform-appropriate `testtrack` binary and call `testtrack schema link --force` on each developer's machine.
We recommend [Scripts To Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) as a pattern for bootstrapping app development environments for your team.

6. Wire up testtrack to your build/deploy pipeline

  a. Set an ENV var named `TESTTRACK_CLI_URL` with your TestTrack app credentials, e.g.:

  ```bash
  TESTTRACK_CLI_URL=https://my_app:my_super_secret_app_token@testtrack.mydomain.com
  ```

  into your build/deploy pipeline via whatever secrets management solution you use (heroku secrets, [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops), etc).

  b. Make sure the platform-appropriate `testtrack` binary is installed in your build/deploy environment (e.g. Jenkins, GoCD)

  c. Run `testtrack migrate` from your app root. For server-side apps, this is great to wire up to the same build pipeline phase where you'd apply database migrations for your app. For mobile or other client-side apps, you'll want to run it after tests have passed and before persisting your gold master build artifact.

7. Start creating splits!

```bash
testtrack create feature_gate my_new_feature_q2_2019_enabled
```

8. Retire splits

Once an experiment is finished or feature released, remove all references to split in code. Then, decide and retire split.

```bash
testtrack destroy split my_new_feature_q2_2019_enabled --decision=true
```

Run `testtrack help` for more documentation on how to configure splits and other TestTrack resources.

Happy TestTracking!

## How to Contribute

We would love for you to contribute! Anything that benefits the majority of TestTrack users—from a documentation fix to an entirely new feature—is encouraged.

Before diving in, [check our issue tracker](https://github.com/Betterment/testtrack-cli/issues) and consider creating a new issue to get early feedback on your proposed change.

### Suggested Workflow

* Fork the project and create a new branch for your contribution.
* Write your contribution (and any applicable test coverage).
* Make sure all tests pass (`make test`).
* Submit a pull request.

### Some tips for those new to golang

* Set up your workspace according to [go standards](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Organization).
* For macOS and homebrew users, run `brew bundle` to install `go` itself.
* Run `dep ensure` to install go dependencies.
* Build and run the CLI using `go run testtrack/main.go`.
